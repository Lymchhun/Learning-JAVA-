/* Instruction:
Create a Book Class
Create a class named Book with
title (String)

Write a constructor that initializes these properties.
Implement a method displayDetails that prints the book's title, author, and price.
Implement a method applyDiscount that takes a percentage as an argument and reduces the
price by that percentage.
In the main method:
Create an instance of Book with sample data.
Display the book's details.
